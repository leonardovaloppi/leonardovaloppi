# Nice to meet you! ✨
### Welcome to my GitHub space! 🚀

## Who am I? 🤔
I’m a Data Analyst specializing in Cohort Analysis, Funnels, and A/B testing, using data to uncover strategic insights and drive business decisions 🤯

What fascinates me most about data is its ability to communicate meaning, transforming raw figures into actionable insights that shape strategies and create impact.
